# About

This project is part of The Odin Project. It is one of the last projects in the 'Foundations' Javascript section. 

It focuses on showcasing html, css and javascript capabilities. Some of which include DOM manipulation using javascript and events.

# Technology Used
 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

# Known issues/future considerations

- The screen reactivity is not as good on mobile browsers and smaller screens. I can improve on this at a later stage once I have completed the reactivity portion of the course.
- I can also make the AC button change to a delete button once the screen has some values.
